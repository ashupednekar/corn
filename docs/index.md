# serve-rs: A Gunicorn Replacement That Doesn’t Make You Cry  

## Installation  

Why wrestle with Gunicorn’s infinite config options when you can just **install serve-rs** and move on with your life?  

```bash  
pip install serve-rs  
```  

## Why You’ll Never Look at Gunicorn Again  

- **No more endless worker models** – You don’t have to Google *"Gunicorn workers explained like I'm five"*.  
- **Processes? In 2025?** – In the age of **containers and serverless**, why are you still micromanaging worker PIDs?  
- **Rust-powered speed** – Because Python’s GIL has slowed you down enough already.  
- **Dead simple deployment** – You don’t need an entire config file just to start your server.  
- **Works with Django** – Because you already have enough problems dealing with its ORM.  

### TL;DR: Run `serve-rs` and get back to building your app.
